# Notification Sounds

This directory contains sound files for notifications.

To properly enable notification sounds, you need to add MP3 files with the following names:

- `notification.mp3` - Default notification sound
- `user_registered.mp3` - Sound for new user registrations
- `exhibition_created.mp3` - Sound for new exhibitions
- `stall_booked.mp3` - Sound for stall bookings
- `stall_updated.mp3` - Sound for stall updates
- `application_received.mp3` - Sound for new applications
- `general.mp3` - Sound for general notifications

You can download free sounds from sites like:

- [Freesound](https://freesound.org/search/?q=notification)

For now, the application is configured to use just the default `notification.mp3` file for all notification types.
