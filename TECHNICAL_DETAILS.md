# Exhibae Connect - Technical Implementation Details

## Architecture Overview

Exhibae Connect is built using a modern web application stack with a focus on performance, scalability, and developer experience. The application follows a client-server architecture with a React frontend and Supabase backend.

## Frontend Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **React 18**: Component-based UI library
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for improved code quality
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: Data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library built on Radix UI primitives

### Key Frontend Components

#### UI Components
- Custom UI components built with Shadcn UI
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Form handling with React Hook Form and Zod validation
- Toast notifications using Sonner
- Modal dialogs using Radix UI Dialog
- Date handling with date-fns

#### State Management
- React Query for server state management
- React Context for global application state
- Local component state for UI-specific state

#### Routing
- React Router DOM for client-side routing
- Protected routes for authenticated sections
- Role-based access control

## Backend Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service platform
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Storage for files and images
  - Real-time subscriptions
  - Row-level security policies

### Database Schema

#### Key Tables
- `profiles`: User profiles with role-specific information
- `exhibitions`: Exhibition details and metadata
- `stalls`: Stall configurations for exhibitions
- `stall_instances`: Individual stall placements within exhibitions
- `exhibition_applications`: Applications from brands for stalls
- `brand_gallery`: Image galleries for brands
- `brand_lookbooks`: Brand lookbooks and catalogs
- `exhibition_interests`: Brand interest in exhibitions
- `exhibition_attendance`: User RSVPs for exhibitions

#### Relationships
- One-to-many relationship between organizers and exhibitions
- One-to-many relationship between exhibitions and stalls
- One-to-many relationship between stalls and stall instances
- Many-to-many relationship between brands and exhibitions through applications

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Flow
1. User registration with email/password or social providers
2. JWT-based authentication using Supabase Auth
3. Token refresh handling for persistent sessions

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (Brand, Organizer, Shopper, Manager)
- Row-level security policies in Supabase
- Client-side route protection based on user roles

## API Integration

### Data Fetching
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Optimistic updates for improved UX
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Real-time Features
- Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Notification system for application status changes
- Chat functionality between brands and organizers

## Deployment and Infrastructure

### Deployment Process
1. Build process using Vite
2. Environment-specific configuration
3. Apache server hosting
4. URL rewriting with .htaccess

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- Build and test automation
- Environment variable management

## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend Optimizations
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Lazy loading of components
- Image optimization
- Memoization of expensive computations

### Backend Optimizations
- Efficient database queries
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Pagination for large data sets

## Security Measures

- HTTPS for all communications
- JWT-based authentication
- Input validation with Zod
- Row-level security in Supabase
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

## Testing Strategy

- Component testing with React Testing Library
- API testing with Postman/Insomnia
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
- Manual testing for critical user flows

## Monitoring and Analytics

- Error tracking with console logging
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics for feature usage
- Database query performance monitoring

## Future Technical Enhancements

1. **Mobile Application**: Native mobile apps using React Native
2. **Payment Integration**: Stripe integration for direct payments
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Dashboard for exhibition performance
4. **AI Features**: Recommendation system for exhibitions and brands
5. **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities
6. **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization and localization
